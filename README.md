# OS

I don't really know what to call this but OS is fine.

I followed [this](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial) tutorial to get a better understanding of how operating systems function.

I'll be rewriting `libc` into a really bad form of `stdio` sometime in the future. I will also add actual commands to the shell and support for lowercase characters.

Also this only supports the x86 architecture, and is 32-bit
